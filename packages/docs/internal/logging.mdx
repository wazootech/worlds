## Logs service

The `LogsService` manages logs within a world's database. It is defined in `lib/database/world/logs/service.ts`. It provides:

- `listByWorld(worldId, limit)` (descending order).
- `listSince(sinceTimestamp, limit)` (ascending order).

## Log levels

The platform uses standard log levels: `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug`.

## Log triggers

Certain platform events automatically trigger log entries in the world-scoped database:

| Event         | World ID source | Level | Notes                                    |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| World created | New world `id`  | info  | Includes label in metadata.              |
| World updated | `:world`        | info  | Includes changed fields in metadata.     |
| World deleted | `:world`        | info  | Created before deletion for audit trail. |
| SPARQL query  | `:world`        | info  | Includes query type or size.             |
| SPARQL update | `:world`        | info  | Includes update type.                    |
