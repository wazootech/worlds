description: "How to authenticate requests to the Worlds API"
---

The Worlds API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. You must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Generating an API key

<Note>
  You must have a valid API key before you can make requests to the API.
</Note>

- **Cloud**: Generate an API key in the [dashboard](https://console.wazoo.dev/settings).
- **Self-hosted**: Use the `WORLDS_API_KEY` configured in your server's environment. This acts as the **Root Admin Key** for your instance and is typically generated and managed by your provisioner.

### Unprotected mode

To facilitate rapid prototyping and simplify local development, the `WORLDS_API_KEY` is **optional**.

> [!WARNING]
> If you do not provide a `WORLDS_API_KEY`, the server will run in **unprotected mode**, granting full administrative access to all requests without authentication. This state is strictly intended for local development and sandbox environments.

## Usage

### Header format

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### SDK example

The SDK handles authentication for you automatically when you initialize the client.

```typescript
import { WorldsSdk } from "@wazoo/worlds-sdk";

const sdk = new WorldsSdk({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
});
```

## Admin access

Certain endpoints, such as listing all worlds for an account, require an admin API key. If you are self-hosting, this is the same as your `WORLDS_API_KEY`.
