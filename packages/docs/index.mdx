## Overview

**Worlds API™** is a REST API designed to manage, query, update, and reason over [SPARQL 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/)-compatible knowledge bases at the edge. It places malleable knowledge within arm's reach of your AI agent.

We operate on the concept of **Worlds**—isolated, queryable knowledge bases that your agents can interact with.
