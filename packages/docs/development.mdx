description: "Run the entire Worlds Platform™ ecosystem locally on your machine."
---

The Worlds Platform™ is designed with a **local-first** philosophy. You can boot the entire ecosystem—including the Management Console and any number of World API instances—using only your local filesystem and Deno runtime.

<Info>
  **Architecture Overview**: For a deep dive into how the platform swaps between
  local and remote managers, see the [Comprehensive Mental Model](/hosting).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

To develop on the Worlds Platform™, you'll need the following tools:

- **Deno** (latest) for the Server, SDK, and CLI.
- **Node.js** (v20+) for the Console and Documentation.
- **Git** for version control.

## 1. Setup the Console

The Console orchestrates all other resources. In local mode, it uses `data/workos.json` as a mock identity provider.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone & Install">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wazootech/worlds.git
cd worlds/packages/console
npm install
```

</Step>
<Step title="Environment Configuration">

Copy the example environment file. **Skip the WorkOS variables**, to trigger Local Dev Mode.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

</Step>
<Step title="Run the Console">

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Booting World Instances

Once the Console is running, it will automatically manage local World API processes.

- **Automatic Boot**: On startup, the Console checks `data/workos.json` and spawns a `deno serve` process for every local organization found.
- **Dynamic Provisioning**: When you create a new Organization in the Console UI, it will:
  1. Generate a local API Key.
  2. Create a local SQLite database in `data/{org_id}/worlds.db`.
  3. Spawn a new World API server on an available local port.

## 3. Local Resource Persistence

During local development, all state is stored in the `packages/console/data` directory. This directory mirrors the resource hierarchy (Organizations > Worlds) using the local filesystem.

```text
packages/console/data/
├── workos.json           # Mock database for Organizations and Users
└── {org_id}/             # Root directory for a specific Organization
    ├── worlds.db         # Primary libSQL DB (registry of worlds for the org)
    └── worlds/           # Directory for individual World databases
        └── {world_id}.db # Secondary libSQL DB (triples & embeddings for a world)
```

## Monorepo Structure

| Package           | Description                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `packages/server` | The core REST API implementation.         |
| `packages/sdk`    | Official TypeScript/Deno client.          |
| `packages/cli`    | Command-line tool for managing instances. |
| `packages/docs`   | This documentation site (Mintlify).       |

## Global Tasks

Common tasks can be run from the root of the repository:

- **Format code**: `deno task fmt`
- **Lint code**: `deno task lint`
- **Run tests**: `deno task test`
- **Pre-commit check**: `deno task precommit`

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ports already in use">
    The Console attempts to allocate ports starting from `8001`. If you have
    conflicting services or lingering processes, you can run:

    ```bash
    npm run nuke
    ```

    This will kill all local Deno processes and reset the development lock. Alternatively, you can manually adjust the `apiBaseUrl` in `data/workos.json` and restart the console.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Resetting local state">
    To wipe all local data and start fresh, simply delete the contents of the
    `packages/console/data` directory.
