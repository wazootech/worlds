description: "How state is stored on your local filesystem."
---

During local development, all state is stored in the `packages/console/data` directory. This directory mirrors the resource hierarchy (Organizations > Worlds) using the local filesystem.

```text
packages/console/data/
├── workos.json           # Mock database for Organizations and Users
└── {org_id}/             # Root directory for a specific Organization
    ├── worlds.db         # Primary libSQL DB (registry of worlds for the org)
    └── worlds/           # Directory for individual World databases
        └── {world_id}.db # Secondary libSQL DB (triples & embeddings for a world)
```

## Resetting State

To wipe all local data and start fresh, simply delete the contents of the `packages/console/data` directory.
