## AI Discovery & Context

The [llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps LLM-based agents index content efficiently, acting as a "sitemap for AI." Worlds API automatically provides these discovery indices at the root of the project to help assistants find the most relevant context.

## Overview

**Worlds API** is the foundational **Neuro-Symbolic Context Stack**. It provides the infrastructure to build AI agents with a persistent, mutable, and logically traceable memory—a detachable hippocampus for the next generation of autonomous assistants.

By fusing **Statistical Intuition** (Neural/Vector) with **Logical Precision** (Symbolic/RDF), Worlds API enables agents to navigate a verified map of reality rather than just predicting the next token.

## How it works (at a glance)

Worlds API transforms how agents retain and use knowledge through a structured 4-step pipeline:

- **Ingest**: Sync and extract facts from text, files, and external connectors.
- **Structure**: Materialize "Malleable Knowledge" into a logically consistent RDF graph.
- **Reason**: Execute complex symbolic traversals via **SPARQL** to discover non-obvious relationships.
- **Query**: Retrieve high-precision context using **Hybrid Search** (Vector similarity + Keyword precision + Graph filters).

## The Moat: Neuro-Symbolic Precision

Standard RAG relies on vector similarity, which often fails at logical consistency and complex relationship discovery. Worlds API is built on a **Neuro-Symbolic** architecture:

- **Vector (Intuition)**: Finds "cozy" vibes and semantic similarities.
- **SPARQL (Logic)**: Answers precise questions like "Who is the CEO of the company founded in 2024?".
- **Edge Deployment**: In-memory N3 stores and WASM-compiled SQLite provide millisecond latency globally.

## Foundational Interoperability

Worlds API is an **Agentic Context Stack**, transforming raw data into persistent, logically-traceable memory. We provide the core primitives to build personalized assistants, enterprise-grade reasoning engines, and universal knowledge platforms.
