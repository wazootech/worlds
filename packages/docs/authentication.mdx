---

The Worlds API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. You must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Generating an API Key

You can generate an API key in the [Worlds Console](https://console.wazoo.dev/settings).

## Usage

### Header format

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### SDK Example

The SDK handles authentication for you automatically when you initialize the client.

```typescript
const world = new World({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  // ... other options
});
```

## Admin Access

Certain endpoints (like listing all worlds for an account) require an Admin API key. These keys are typically only used for server-side integrations or by the account owner.
