**Vector Search** allows you to find information in your world based on its *meaning*, rather than exact keyword matches.

## How it Works

1. **Ingestion**: When you insert triples into your world, the API automatically generates embeddings for the subject, predicate, and object.
2. **Indexing**: These embeddings are stored in a vector index.
3. **Querying**: When you perform a search, your query is embedded, and the API finds the semantically closest triples in the index.

## Use Cases

- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Retrieve relevant context for an LLM based on a user's prompt.
- **Fuzzy Finding**: Find entities even if the user doesn't know their exact URI or name.
